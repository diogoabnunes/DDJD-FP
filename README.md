DDJD - Template for game submission structure 
---------------------------------------------

To facilitate archiving, indexing and availability of the DDJD projects on the GIG Arcade (our repository of game projects), we are 
requiring that the submitted zip files with the game include a manifest file and some additional media.

The mandatory items to include are:

 - file: info.json - in the root folder; follow the sample provided and fill all the information regarding the project
 - folder: media - (the files inside it can be removed/replaced) Folder to include snapshots, video(s) and an icon, that should be named in the info.json file. You should have at least one local video (small), other videos may be added by URL in info.json 
 - file: (game.executable) - should be present in the root folder, can have any valid name, but must be identified in the info.json file

All the other files in this sample can be removed/replaced if not needed, and all the files you need to run the game should be included.
